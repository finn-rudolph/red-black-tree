# Type-Generic Red-Black Tree in C

First, include `red_black_tree.h`. To create a Red-Black Tree, call `rb_create` and specify the size of the data to be stored as well as a comparison function. The comparison function takes the same form as for `qsort` from the C standard library. An `RbTree *` is returned, which is needed for all further operations. Values for insertion, deletion, find, etc. are provied via a `void *`, they are be copied to internally managed memory (so the object the `void *` points to can be modified after the operation). After using the Red-Black Tree, `rb_destroy` with the `RbTree *` pointer returned from `rb_create` must be called.

The functions to find an element or the minimum / maximum in the tree return a handle of type `RbNode *`. To get the value in the node, use `rbtree_get_key`. The functions `rb_predecessor` and `rb_successor` return the previous / next node in the order specified by the comparison function, they can be used to iterate over the tree. When a node has no predecessor or successor, a special nil-node is returned. To test whether an `RbNode *` points to such a node, compare against the return value of `rb_nil` for equality. Doing anything else with a nil-node like trying to get a value is undefined behaviour.
